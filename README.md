__WordPress DecaLog SDK__ is a way to use [DecaLog](https://github.com/Pierre-Lannoy/wp-decalog), the free observability toolkit for WordPress, in your own plugins or themes.

You may use this SDK on all WordPress installations: if __DecaLog__ is installed your users will take advantage of all the efforts you've made to report events and provide metrics or traces; if __DecaLog__ is not installed, the SDK will silently discard all these important informations...
